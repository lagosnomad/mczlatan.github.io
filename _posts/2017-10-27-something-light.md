![Something Light](../assets/images/post-bg-13.jpg)

I mean, 2017 has been a great year for me so far.

- I started writing Javascript in March.
- It's October and I can build solid scalable web apps using the MEAN stack.
- I write TypeScript to a solid level.
- And to top it, I can write micro libraries too.

Whoa! A year full of Javascript.

# [yoruba-names](https://github.com/mczlatan/yoruba-names)

I had dirty data scraped off [yorubaname.com](http://www.yorubaname.com/) for a while now and I didn't know what to do with it. I decided to build a JavaScript library around it.

[yoruba-names](https://github.com/mczlatan/yoruba-names) allows you to generate a random yoruba name. You can combine two names also to get a full name, and you can return any specifeid amount of names you want generated too.

## Challenges

- I had no idea how or where to start from
- I knew this would be a lot of work
- I was scared because i didn't want this to be another half way abandoned project lost somewhere on my computer.

## How I started

- Google everything literally
- Took a course on [eggheads.io](https://egghead.io/) that was remendously helpful

## Tools I used

- **[Git and Github](https://github.com)**
- **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)** and **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)**
- **[Mocha](https://mochajs.org)** and **[Chai](chaijs.com)** for testing
- **[Semantic-Release-Cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release-cli)** for automatic deployment and release
- **[Commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen)** for writing and making proper commits
- **[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org)** for Continious Integrations
- **[Ghooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghooks)** for automatically running tests before commits
- **[Istanbul](https://www.npmjs.com/package/istanbul)** and **[CodeCov](https://codecov.io)** for code coverage
- **[WebPack](https://webpack.js.org)** and **[Babel](https://babeljs.io)** for building and compiling for browser

## Experience

**Jesus Christ, it was haaaaaaarrrrrrrdddddddd**, I won't sugar coat it.
Like this is the simplest form of a JavaScript micro library and it was this hard?
But nevertheless:

- It was hard one more time
- It was fun
- Learnt a lot about tools used in building from scratch to deployment
- I learnt a bit of ES6
- I felt like i was progressing (I am actually)

# In conclusion

Lol, I really don't know how to conclude but I hope you understand.

If you've got questions about [yoruba-names](https://github.com/mczlatan/yoruba-names) or tools I used when building, [tweet at me](/). I tweet and retweet about the latest dev and sec stuffs.

Cheers!!! ✌✌✌
