<h2 class="section-heading">Quick Story</h2>


```
ME: January 1: It's a new year. I want to start blogging and I will 
    write one blog post every week and be famous at the end of the year.

ME: Today:  ...writing my 4th post this year.
```

<p>Whoaaaa! What a year it has been!</p>

<p>
    When this year started, I had big dreams. Write a blog post every week, meet Mark Zuckerberg (tbh this almost happend, i was stucked in traffic to CCHUB, when i got there, Uncle Mark had left **sobs**), launch a rocket, travel the whole world in one week, etc, etc, etc, and right now, I'm far away from those set targets.

### Blogging or dy/dx ?
<p>
    dy/dx please! 
</p>


### Why? Because blogging is so difficult. Really, it is.
<p>
    Blogging for me isn't difficult because
    <ul>
        <li>There's no idea of what to write or</li>
        <li>Because I don't plan on earning money or</li>
        <li>etx, etc, etc.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Blogging for me is difficult because
    <ul>
        <li>I don't have time.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


### How do you guys do it?
<p>
Personally, I'm going to try to start dedicating more time to blogging. It seems it's 
needed if you are going to have that bombing tech resume (Because every top tier tech guy I know has a little blog).
Here's what i plan to do:
    <ul>
        <li>Make time for blogging, at least one post a week isn't too bad i think.</li>
        <li>Write down everything (every problem) i google everyday and make blog post on the most interesting ones.</li>
        <li>Try to be consistent.</li>
    </ul>
    If you are already familiar with blogging, please feel free to tweet at me to help my career!

### Blogging or Togo's Jollof Rice?
<p>
Togo's Jollof Rice please! Just because i'm eating Mama Togo's jollof rice right now.
Techies at yaba can testify to this woman's jollof rice.
I'm not saying it's better than the Nigerian Jollof tho, but damn ...
