Cafe Neo boasts to be the biggest and Nigeria's fastest fastest-growing coffee chain with about ten outlets in Lagos alone.
**Neo**, means “*gift*” in Tswana and this encapsulates their view of coffee as a resource that should be shared and cherished. Cafe Neo fine coffee is grown in Africa.

            In a state today where many of our best minds face fundamental roadblocks that inhibit their progress (lack of power, internet, etc.), Cafe Neo also offers has a co-working space in their stores.

        <p>
            Working from the co-work space gives you access to power, condusive working environment, more focus as there's less distractions and even treat yoyrself to some cups of coffee.

# My Experience
<div class="side-by-side">
    <div class="toleft">
        <p>
            I was on my way back from Surulere to work when the rain caught me on the road, luckily enough for me it didn't beat me too much. I decided to stop by the the Cafe Neo store at Sanusi Fafunwa, Victoria Island. It was quite empty because i was expecting Lagosians to be there buying coffee for the weather. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I particularly liked the Large chalkboard menu behind the counter. It showed all that was on the menu and the price. From hot drinks like Cappuccino, Caramel Macchiato, Espresso, Americano, Cafe Latte, Cafe Mocha, etc, to cold drinks like Bubble Tea, Caramel Frappucino, Iced Cafe Mocha. The pastries also caught my eyes, especially the Carrot Cake and Croissant.

        It was a good first time visit to Cafe Neo and it was a good one. My Coffee was perfect, my Carrot Cake was yummy, the co-working space was comfortable and i would definitely go back there to work for maybe a whole day for more experience.
