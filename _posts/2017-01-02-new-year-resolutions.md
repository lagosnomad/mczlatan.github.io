<h2 class="section-heading">New year and time conspiracy</h2>


```
ME: Speaking from a pythonic perspective, has anyone noticed that Time is just a recursive function
that yeilds a value and just picks up from the last yielded value when it calls itself again? hmmmm

```

<p>It's a new year again, and i'm glad we all made it, even though we might not have hit every target
    we set for ourselves in 2016, or we are not where we visioned ourselves to be yet, let's see 2017 as
    another opportunity to hit that goal.    
</p>

<p>As usual, i'm sure many of us got tons of brodcast messages wishing us a happy new year, this and that, but wait, am i
    the only one bored out from hearing the usual new year resolutions like "New year, new me", "New year, new system", etc ?
    I have recieved tons of broadcasts (Most of them having a warning tone) asking not to mess with them this year, etc. and i'm just tired.
</p>

<p>This whole resolution thing inspired me to share my exprience with resolutions, why and how i feel they are important.
    I'm not talking about the "New year, new me" resolutions, but Screen Resolutions.
</p>


### My experience with screen resolutions
<p>Back in my first days of development, i had learnt how to code css, which i found stressful, but it was needed.
    One of my major headaches when learning css was defining break points for screen sizes.
    I just didn't get it, and i still haven't gotten it.
    It was in this my predicament i came across responsive css libraries like Bootstrap which made life easy.
    With these libraries, breakpoints for most screen types and devices have been implemented.
    Now all i do is pick up the library - the minified version just for speed optimization, CDNify it - for speed optimization too,
    and use the rules in my html code. Easy life.
</p>


### Why and how i think they are important.
<p>
    If you are reading this blog post, chances are that you are doing so from your mobile device - Smartphone or Tablet,
    and the way this post is displayed for you is going to be different from when you view it on your desktop computer
    or laptop. Your device screen resolution is responsible for this. I have listed a few reasons i think resolutions
    are important in a user interface design.
    <ul>
        <li>They define breakpoints in our user interface.</li>
        <li>They allow us have different views on different devices.</li>
        <li>They are key elements in designing a responsive user interface.</li>
    </ul>
    There might be other importance of screen resolutions, professional designers will be able to say
    more about how important they are in our user interface design and presentation.
</p>


### Css libraries you can check out
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.purecss.io">Pure Css</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.materialize.com">Materialize Css</a>.</li>

        <li><a href="http://www.getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    Just a few of the many available css libraries that allow mobile responsiveness.
</p>


### Popular devices and their screen resolutions
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apple Ipad 1 and 2 - 1224x768</li>
        <li>Apple Iphone 6 and 6s - 1334x750</li>
        <li>Apple Iphone 6+ and 6s+ - 1920x1080</li>
        <li>Blackberry Playbook - 1024x600</li>
        <li>Blackberry z10 - 1280x768</li>
        <li>Blackberry q10 - 720x720</li>
        <li>Infinix Hot 2 - 720x1280</li>
        <li>Lenovo Thinkpad - 1280x800</li>
        <li>Lumia 900 - 480x800</li>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy 3 - 1280x720</li>
        <li>Samsung j1 Ace - 480x800</li>
        <li>Samsung s4 and s5 - 1920x1080</li>
        <li>Samsung s6, s6 Edge, s6 Edge+ - 2560x1440</li>
        <li>Samsung s7, s7 Edge - 2560x1440</li>
    </ul>
    These are just a few of popular devices in my location and as we all know, there are
    soooooooooooooooooooooooo many devices and you can't afford not
    to use a reponsive user interface based on the resolutions of these devices.
    And good thing that the popular breakpoints for most devices such as 1280, 1024, 800, 720, 600, 480, 320
    are implemented by most responisive css libraries out there, and if you ever want to write your own custom css code
    or css library, you have to take screen resolutions keenly, because they are what defines respnsiveness of your user
    interface on different devices of your users.
