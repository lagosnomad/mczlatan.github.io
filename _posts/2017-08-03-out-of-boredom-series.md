![Out of Boredom series](../assets/images/post-bg-10.jpg)

<h2 class="section-heading">Unboring Boredom Fact</h2>

```
I did a quick five minute search on google looking for 
intersting boredom facts.  Guess what? I got bored doing that.
```

<p>Please don't get bored reading this post.</p>

<p>
    I got bored at work today. I had stuff to do but my mortal self didnt want to cooperate. I tried so many activities trying to clear my head. I took a walk, ate, tried to watch a movie, listend to music, etc.  None worked so i gave up. I guess i was bored (of work?)
</p>

<p>
    While scribling and scrambling around, I stumbled on <a href="https://github.com/akinjide/aboki">a Github project</a> 
    by <a href="https://github.com/akinjide">Akinjide Bankole</a>. The project allows us to view black market currency rate instantly in your terminal! (Nigeria Only) and it worked by scraping data from <a href="https://www.abokifx.com">AbokiFX</a>.
    Try it out by in your terminal:
</p>
```
$ sudo pip install aboki

$ aboki --help
```


### Okay so how does this relate to boredom?
<p>
    Long story short out of boredom, I built a minified API around it and built a mobile app that allows you to see
    the current exchange rate in US Dollars, Great Britain Pounds and Euros.
</p>


### STACK for the API
<p>
    <li>Python</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Flask</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flask-Restful</li>
                    <li>Flask-CORS</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Tornado</li>
            <li>Aboki</li>
        </ul>
</p>

### STACK for the Mobile App
<p>
    <li>Ionic 1.x</li>
    <ul>
            <li>Cordova</li>
            <li>AngularJS</li>
            <li>NodeJS</li>
        </ul>
</p>

### Ok cool stuff, but you've still not said your plan to conquer boredom
<p>
    Personally I'll be building small time apps and blogging about them in the "Out of boredom series" when i'm bored so i can 
    <ul>
        <li>"Unbore myself"</li>
        <li>Still make the best out of lost time</li>
        <li>Learn new things</li>
        <li>Remain creative</li>
        <li>etc, etc, etc.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

### Where's the API at?

    Hosted on a personal server, but check out
